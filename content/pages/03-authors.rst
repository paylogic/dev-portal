This page lists a small profile of the Paylogic employees who have published
articles on this website.

Peter Odding
============

Peter is the team lead of the operational IT team. His day to day job is a
combination of devops, team management, contact with other departments in
Paylogic and contact with external parties (technology partners).

He started programming when he was twelve and he has a passion for automation,
packaging and high availability. If it can be automated he'll do it at some
point :-). You can contact him through `his Twitter account
<http://twitter.com/peterodding>`_ or by sending him an `e-mail
<peter@peterodding.com>`_.

Òscar Vilaplana
===============

Òscar is one of Paylogic's architecture team. He's currently working on the
Paylogic's new API that will allow third parties to sell tickets using Paylogic
through their own sites and apps. He is a passionate supporter of clear, simple
and well designed code.

When he is not coding or designing software, or reading books about it, he is
probably biking around on his recumbent bike, messing around with improv comedy
or desecrating old master's works on his piano.

Find him on Twitter as `@grimborg <http://twitter.com/grimborg>`_, check out
his `blog <http://oscarvilaplana.cat>`_ or drop him a line on
