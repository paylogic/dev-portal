Ã’scar is one of Paylogic's architecture team. He's currently working on the
Paylogic's new API that will allow third parties to sell tickets using Paylogic
through their own sites and apps. He is a passionate supporter of clear, simple
and well designed code.

When he is not coding or designing software, or reading books about it, he is
probably biking around on his recumbent bike, messing around with improv comedy
or desecrating old master's works on his piano.

Find him on Twitter as `@grimborg <http://twitter.com/grimborg>`_, check out
his `blog <http://oscarvilaplana.cat>`_ or drop him a line on
`dev@oscarvilaplana.cat <dev@oscarvilaplana.cat>`_.
